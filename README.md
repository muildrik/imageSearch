# About
This repo is based on the final project for a Computer Vision course (CSCI1430) taught by James Tompkin at Brown University in 2020. The goal of that project was to integrate a live videostream from any mobile device for the purpose of realtime image recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) technology and co-developed with Camillo Saueressig (https://github.com/csaueres).

This repo is under construction and will be updated as I'm cleaning up the original project files. I'm also integrating our scripts with a Django web interface to make the application directly accessible and operational.
