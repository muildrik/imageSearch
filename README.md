# About
This repo is based on the final project for a Computer Vision course (CSCI1430) taught by James Tompkin at Brown University in 2020. The goal of that project was to integrate a live videostream from any mobile device for the purpose of realtime image recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) technology and co-developed with Camillo Saueressig (https://github.com/csaueres).

The original application was built in Node.js to work with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and consisted of two separate repos, one for the backend and the other for the frontend.

For efficiency I am rewriting this application in Python, converting the Node.js frontend to Django.

# Goals
This application is meant to subject a video feed to a Deep Learned Neural Net.

**This repo is under construction and will be updated as I'm cleaning up the original project files. I'm also integrating our scripts with a Django web interface to make the application directly accessible and operational.**
